## Abstract
It is a well known fact that smoking kills and more specifically it increases your chances of developing lung cancer. However, research states that 80-90% of lung cancer cases are linked to smoking. Then what is the other 10-20% caused by? In this study we will take a closer look at lung cancer findings from the United States and identify which demographic factors contribute to higher lung cancer rates by taking a look at both incidence and death. We will do this by fitting two linear models and observing which variables are significant in each. Also, by taking a look at the US counties with high values of incidence and death we can showcase the significant variables in action. This will allow us to not only find which factors contribute to cancer cases but also if certain factors impact incidence more or death.

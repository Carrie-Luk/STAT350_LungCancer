# Modelling Lung Cancer Incidence and Death Rates in U.S. Counties
By Elizabeth Audrey Gunawan, Ameet Khaira, Carrie Luk and Sheril Natasha

## Abstract
Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide, with 18 million new cases in 2018 alone. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, “cancer rates are highest in areas whose populations have the highest life expectancy and standard of living”. In this study we will take a closer look at lung cancer findings from the United States and identify which variables in our dataset contribute to higher incidence and death rates. We will do this by fitting two linear models and observing which variables are significant in each. Also, by taking a look at the US counties with high values of incidence and cancer we can showcase the significant variables in action. By identifying demographic factors which have a strong correlation to cancer, we can interpret not only why these factors correlate but also if anything can be done to slow down cancer rates.
